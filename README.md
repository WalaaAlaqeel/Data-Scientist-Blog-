# Project Motivation

Based on Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), the Boston and Seatle Airbnb datasets were collected and investigated. 

The primary questions that will be answered in this project are:

- Is there any noticeable difference between Seattle and Boston Airbnb?
- What are the most important features to estimate Airbnb rental price?
- What are the top amenities people needs most?
